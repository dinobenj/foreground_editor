# foreground_editor
This is just a fun side project that I am currently working on.
This program will take the foreground of an image and replace it with a bunch of randomly generated pixels.
I hope to make it somewhat of an actual gradient rather than just taking a sample of pixels on top of an image.


-The new iteration takes the 4 corners of an image with a changeable sample size as some images may require more data to generate a more accurate image.
