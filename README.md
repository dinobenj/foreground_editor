# foreground_editor
This is just a fun side project that I am currently working on.
The program takes an image, scans the top row of pixels of the image, and returns an image where all pixels not in that top row are removed.
I hope to make it somewhat of an actual gradient rather than just taking a sample of pixels on top of an image.
